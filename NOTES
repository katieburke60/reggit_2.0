(1) Improve the way that a selected regulation renders to the page
VOTES
- Count the up and down votes (should be an enumerable for this)
- Visualize in some sort of chart
- Add a voteGraph component
- Put the chart as a box above the comments box
COMMENTS
- Put in a more visually compelling way
- Have them go down the right side of the screen
- [Longer-term] have it so that you can click something to see or hide the box of comments
OVERALL
- ADD NAVIGATION BAR (including full list option)
- Way to remove current regulation from the store so that it renders full list again

(2) Add components, reducers, and actions to allow for voting and comment submission

(3) Improve layout and visuals for the regulations list page

(4) Create a login and authenticate users


Longer-term ideas
- Allow people to highlight and comment on specific portion of the rules
- Have a formal comment box for submission to agencies
